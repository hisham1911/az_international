## STANDARD NDT SERVICES

**AZ NDT SERVICES & NDT RESOURCES (AZ)** offers all standard NDT methods employing state-of-the-art equipment. All equipment is easily portable for all field applications.

### Ultrasonic Testing (UT)

Ultrasonic Testing is an efficient, accurate way to detect surface and internal flaws in critical components. **AZ** skilled technicians perform a variety of contact UT techniques, including longitudinal wave for thickness measurements, shear wave for weld inspection and surface wave methods.

### Magnetic Particle (MT)

Magnetic particle testing is an economical means of detecting surface and slightly subsurface defects in all-ferromagnetic materials. MT can find extremely small defects such as cracks, seams and laminations that could cause component failure. This method is ideal for rapid maintenance testing or critical equipment such as cranes, crane hooks, forklifts and other lifting devices.

### Liquid Penetrant (PT)

Liquid Penetrant testing utilizing fluorescent and visible methods is used to locate surface defects on any nonferrous surface. PT is sensitive to very small defects including cracks, seams, pits and other defects open to the surface.

## SPECIALIZED INSPECTION SERVICES

### 1. Turnaround Inspection

For complete turnaround support, AZ provides experienced personnel, technical resources, equipment, and project management. AZ's large inventory of advanced testing equipment and technical programs are designed to meet all your inspection requirements. Experienced project managers ensure that your turnaround is completed smoothly and on schedule.

### Refinery Equipment Inspection

**Inspection of all areas of plants:**

- Pressure Vessels & Drums

### Wet Magnetic Inspection Program

Proven methods for wet fluorescent magnetic particle inspection allow our experienced technicians to detect blistering, hydrogen or sulfide induced cracking in vessel, spheres, towers and other equipment. With the help of advanced database programs, our technicians record inspection findings, follow up with retesting after repairs, and thoroughly document it all for comparison and trending with past or future inspections.

### Heat Exchanger Inspection Program

We have combined the full range of services for the evaluation of heat exchangers into a single comprehensive program. Our STEEL Test system provides rapid and accurate inspection of ferromagnetic heat exchanger tubing from the tube I.D. Other I.D. tube inspection methods in our programs include remote visual inspection. Advanced computerized reporting and trending capabilities are also included.

### Tank Integrity Program

**AZ's** Tank Integrity Program provides all the necessary internal and external tank inspections and documentation to comply with API Standard 653. All inspections are certified and follow comprehensive procedures for both in-service and out-of-service inspections.

- External Visual Inspection
- Vacuum Box Testing of the floor seams
- Ultrasonic for thickness and weld integrity
- Magnetic Particle and Liquid Penetrant Testing for material integrity
- Positive Material Identification (PMI)
- Metallurgical Analysis
- Failure Analysis
- Weld Procedure Qualification
- Welder Certification
- Engineer Review, Calculations and Recommendations

### On-Stream Inspection Program

**AZ** on stream Inspection Program effectively identifies replacement needs before our scheduled turnarounds. **AZ** uses high temperature ultrasonic techniques in conjunction with insulation coring/replacement plug installation locate and measure wall thinning in insulated piping while in operation. We are able to provide you with the data necessary for advance run/repair/replacement decisions and planning to assure the safety of critical systems and reduce the turnaround time.

### Portable Alloy Analysis (PMI)

**AZ** Alloy Identification system accurately analyzes the elemental composition of metals and precisely identifies hundreds of alloys. Whether it is an incoming material inspection or an on-site replacement of critical parts, a few seconds are all that is necessary to positively identify almost any alloy. This saves clients time & money through avoidance of sending material samples to a metallurgical laboratory. **AZ** provides the most advanced equipment for positive material identification utilizing the Texas Nuclear Metallurgist XR. Such a technique allows AZ to identify and analyze 22 basic elements within seconds.

**Applications:**

- Receiving inspection
- In-Service inspection
- Failure analysis
- Material sorting
- Material salvage operations

### Vendor Surveillance Program

Any organization you contract to manufacture, fabricate or supply an item or service incidental to the design, construction, operation or testing of a component of facility is a vendor that can be audited by **AZ's** Vendor Surveillance Program. Our experience covers a wide variety of projects, from foundation materials, structural steel and furnace fabrication to heat exchangers, pressure vessels, electric motors, valves, steam Turbines, stacks, tanks, electrical components, pipe, pumps and compressors. You save the considerable cost of coordinating an in-house system and can be confident your vendors are performing at peak efficiency with our complete surveillance service.

### Internal Bore Ultrasonic Service

**AZ's** Internal bore UT service provides precision ultrasonic thickness measurement of inaccessible boiler and heat exchanger tubing. Our experienced technicians work inside the boiler drum or from the tube sheet, inserting an ultrasonic probe into the ID of each drum or from the tube sheet, and measuring thickness 360 degrees inside the tube. This method eliminates the need for costly scaffolding, surface preparation and insulation removal.

### Surface Replication

**AZ's** experienced metallurgical technicians perform surface replication, an evaluation to detect creep voids on plant equipment in the early stages of formation without damaging the component or cutting a sample. It is also effective for detection and evaluation of inter granular corrosion including IGSCC, micro cracking, carbide precipitation, carbonization, inclusions, damage caused by over temperature excursions or thermal, cycling and various other conditions. We provide information on-site to allow immediate corrective action, when required. When creep voids are detected early, you have adequate time to make operational changes to slow the creep void mechanism, repair or replace the components and plan for the future.

### Engineering Services

Through working relationship with a number of top engineering firms, we can provide complete engineering services in conjunction with our testing services. We provide stress analysis, critical flow size determination, disposition of defects, selection of inspection points, conditions assessment programs, remaining life determination and other additional services.

### Mid-Wall Creep Fissure Detector

An ultrasonic system for detecting creep fissuring in reformer and riser tubes, allowing the condition of tubes to be diagnosed during routine plant maintenance. Examination is fast & efficient, without the need for removing the catalyst, restricting or interfering with other work in the reformer, or furnace staging in most cases. Tubes are examined in-place, allowing inspection of 100% of accessible tube length. Computerized reports and strip-chart records are generated upon completion of inspection, clearly identifying the condition of each tube.
